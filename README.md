# Hybrid-Model-for-Privacy-Enhancing-Distributed-Data-Mining


This study introduces a novel hybrid-security model that combines the advantages of centralized and distributed data mining systems. The model offers two levels of security. The first level involves transforming individual datasets into a non-understandable form using a four-dimensional rotation transformation. The second level employs a secure distributed data mining technique called the ratio of secure summation protocol. The efficiency and accuracy of the hybrid model are verified using common data mining techniques such as k-means clustering and na√Øve Bayes classification. The model ensures data security without compromising data quality. The accuracy achieved in classification and clustering tasks using the hybrid security model is high when applied to different datasets in a privacy-enhanced distributed data mining environment. The study presents the layout of the hybrid-security model and defines the problem statement, which involves building a hybrid-security privacy-enhanced distributed data mining model.

The problem statement is divided into two phases:
1. Phase I: Application of Centralized Privacy-Enhanced Data Mining (PEDM) Technique.
2. Phase II: Securing Sensitive Information in Distributed Data Mining Systems by applying Distributed PEDM Techniques.

The focus of this work is on securing the distributed data mining process, where multiple users share their data to achieve common goals. The proposed hybrid security model addresses this concern by employing two security techniques in different phases to enhance the overall security of the data mining process. The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy measures. Additionally, the model incorporates level-I security using a four-dimensional rotation transformation technique, which makes it challenging to extract original values from the perturbed dataset. The model also utilizes the RSS-RD protocol in the mining mechanism, further enhancing its security. It can be extended or reduced to accommodate any number of participating parties. The model's accuracy is tested using four datasets and shows improved performance, as depicted in Figure 5(a) and (b). This study concludes that the hybrid-security model is practical and applicable in real-life scenarios. It achieves high accuracy in distributed data mining while ensuring fair contributions from all participating parties. However, a limitation of this hybrid model is its applicability only to numeric or categorical datasets. Future plans involve developing a general solution that can work with any type of dataset.
